# Hussein RIP
This is my second attempt at creating a React Native app. This is somewhat a continuation of Fahad RIP with a different subject. (The first friend who failed from the Fahad RIP description). Instead of using Expo I opted to use pure React Native with the community library React-Native-Sound.

## What's the Difference Between This and Fahad RIP
The main difference between this app and Fahad RIP is the lack of EXPO. This choice was mainly made as the uncompressed version of Fahad RIP was near 100mb due to EXPO's nature of packing all the libraries with the app. Instead normal React Native packs only the libraries used which resulted in a much smaller app (~25mb uncompressed).

## Changes From Original 
Almost ever asset was ripped from this app to replace with place holder images and sounds. I replaced the music I used initially to a royalty free song that can be found here: https://www.bensound.com. The random sound bites that play when pressing the F button are also default 1 to 17 text to speech mp3s. This was done to showcase the random file choosing while still protecting the nature of Hussein's identity.
